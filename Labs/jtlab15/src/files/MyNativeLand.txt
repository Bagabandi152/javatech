Magnificent are the ridges of the Khentei, Khangai and Sayan.
Forest-covered mountains are the beauty of the north
Vast are the Gobis of Menen, Sharga and Nomin
Seas of sand dunes, supreme in the south
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Crystal-clear are the rivers of Kherlen, Onon and Tola
Health-giving fountains and hot springs abound
Deep-blue lakes of Kubsgul, Ubsa and Buir
Brooks and freshets quench the thirst of man and beast
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Splendid are the rivers of Orkhon, Selenge and Khokhul
Abundant are the mountain passes rich in minerals
Ancient monuments, ruined cities galore
Broad are the highways that vanish into the distance
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Snow-capped mountains gleam from afar\
Clear blue skies over steppe, plain and field
Majestic glacial peaks are visible far off
Vast airy valleys which calm the mind of man
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Between Khangai and Altai lies the Khalkha land
Where we galloped to and fro since childhood
The long low foothills where we hunted deer and game
The beautiful valleys and hollows we raced our swift steeds
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Undulating sea of grass, when touched by the gentle breeze
Enchanting are the mirages of the wide open plains
Land with severe terrain that produces the best of men
Here are the sacred heights, worshipped since times of yore
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Luxuriant pasturelands full of fine grass
Here is wide open country criss-crossed by our tracks
A land to move as we like in all the four seasons
Where the soil is rich for the five kinds of grains
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
The sacred mountains where our forefathers rest
The land where our children grew, and rear their children
The meadow and valleys filled with the five kinds of stock
Here is the land which entrances all us Mongols
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
In the winterâ€™s tingly cold-a blanket of ice and snow
The land shines like a crystal mirror
In the warmth of summer season- flowers and leaves unfold
Land where distant birds come to sing their songs
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
The fertile virgin lands between Altai and Khangai
Land of our eternal destiny where ancestors lie
Land grown mellow under the golden rays of the sun
Land grown eternal under the silver moon
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Homeland of our ancestors since the days of the Hsiung-nu
Land of great might in the days of the blue Mongols
Land we become more accustomed to with every passing year
Land where now the crimson flags flutter
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
Beloved country of us all who were born and die here
The enemy who dares invade our soil shall perish
Let us build our revolutionary state on the land ordained
Then let us march head high towards the brave future new world
This is my native land
Mongolia the beautiful
